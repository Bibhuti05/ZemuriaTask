## Overview

The application consists of a button that, when clicked, triggers a function. However, due to rate limiting, the function can only be executed once every specified interval (in this case, every 2000 milliseconds). If the button is clicked before the interval has elapsed, a message is displayed to the user indicating how long they need to wait.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure includes:

- A button with the ID `rateLimitButton` for user interaction.
- A `div` element with the class `message` and ID `message` to display feedback to the user.

```html
<button id="rateLimitButton">Click Me!</button>
<div class="message" id="message"></div>
